# iOSRingingRoom
A native iOS client for [Ringing Room](https://github.com/lelandpaul/virtual-ringing-room), now available [on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/ringing-room/id1531929847)!

## Disclaimer
I wrote this code a year ago and have improved a lot since then. Major update in the works!

## Contributing

As this is my first Swift/SwiftUI project, there are undoubtedly many ways to improve it. If you can in any way, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.

Comments coming soon!
