If you have visited a tower before, then you can join it by pressing on its name in the list of recent towers.
If you are joining a tower for the first time, then, in the towers tab, press on 'Join tower by ID'. Type in the ID of the tower you wish to join, and press join.

To create a tower, go to the Towers view and press on 'Create new tower' to reveal a text box and the Create Tower button. Next, type the name of the new tower into the text box. Press Create Tower and you will be sent to a new tower with that name.

Once you're in a tower, you can ring the bells by tapping on their images. If you are assigned a bell, a button for that bell will appear near the bottom of your screen.

You may wish to change the number of bells in the tower, whether you are ringing tower bells or handbells. This can be achieved by selecting the desired option in the Tower Controls. You can access the Tower Controls by clicking on the button at the top-right of the Ringing view. Also available in the tower controls are a list of users, and the chat. You will also be able to assign ringers to bells; this is covered in the Advanced Features section.

Ringing Room has a volume slider that lets you reduce the volume of the bells without affecting the system volume. This is useful if you are using Ringing Room and Zoom (or other apps such as Discord) at the same time on your device - you can lower the volume of the bells, without making peoples' voices quieter.

To access the volume slider, you must be in a tower. Once in a tower, go to the tower controls. Then press on the button with a speaker symbol on it. This will reveal the volume slider. Press the speaker button again to hide the volume slider.

To prevent notifications from silencing the audio and distracting you while ringing, it's a good idea to switch on "Do Not Disturb" before a ringing session. This setting can be found in the Control CentreÂ (it has a crescent moon icon), or search the Settings app to find it. Remember to turn it off again after ringing if you want to see and hear notifications.

The tower controls includes a list of users presently in the tower, which you can use to assign bells to particular ringers. To assign ringers, tap on the name of the ringer you would like to assign, then tap on the number of the bell you would like to assign them to. Tapping the \"x\" to the left of a bell number will un-assign the ringer from that bell. There is also an Un-assign All button, which un-assigns every ringer.

Assigning a user to a bell will have the effect of automatically rotating that ringer's \"perspective\" on the tower so that the bell is placed in the bottom right position. There is more about changing your perspective in the section "Rotating the perspective of the bell circle". For every bell you are assigned to, there will be a large button for ringing that bell.

There is also a button called 'Fill In'. This will randomly assign unassigned ringers to available bells. The Fill In button is only enabled if there are at least as many unassigned ringers as available bells. If Wheatley is in the tower, then Fill In will randomly assign all human ringers a bell, then fill in the rest with Wheatley.

        case .wheatley:

Wheatley is a computer ringer for Ringing Room, made by Ben White-Horne and Matthew Johnson and designed to be a 'ninja helper with no ego' - i.e. Wheatley will any number of bells to whatever you want to ring, but should fit in as much as possible to what you're ringing. Wheatley is now available directly inside Ringing Room, without any installation.

Enabling Wheatley
Wheatley needs to be enabled on a per-tower basis with the switch in the tower settings. This can only be done through the website currently. Once Wheatley is enabled, a user called 'Wheatley' will be present in the users list. You can then assign Wheatley to bells like any other person. The Fill In button will randomly assign all human ringers first, then fill the remaining bells with Wheatley.

To tell Wheatley what to ring, you need to join the tower through the website. The control for Wheatley in the app is coming soon.

To start ringing a method with Wheatley (only on the website):
Click on the "Methods" tab in the Wheatley box.
Click in the text box that says "Start typing method name".
Start typing the name of the method you want to ring. As you type, a list of potential method names will appear (filtered according to the tower size).
Click on the method name you want to ring, or press "Enter" to select the first option.
If everything worked out, the first line of the Wheatley box should say "After 'Look To', Wheatley will ring <your method name>", and Wheatley will ring that method after Look To is called.

Wheatley will still respond to all yours calls from the app, such as Look to, or Stand.

By default, whenever you are assigned a bell, that bell will appear in the bottom right corner of the bell circle. However, if you would like to have control over your perspective of the bell circle, the is a button at the bottom right corner of the bell circle with four arrows in a circle. Pressing this will enter you into Rotate mode. In Rotate mode, when you press a bell, instead of it ringing, it will change your perspective so that bell will be in the bottom right corner, and you will exit Rotate mode. To cancel Rotate mode without changing the perspective, press the button with four arrows in a circle again.

In addition, in the Settings tab, there is an option to disable the automatic rotation of the bell circle when you are assigned a bell.

The Towers tab shows all the towers associated with your account. They are sorted by last visited, with the most recent at the top.

In a later version, you will be able to view separate lists for recent, bookmarked, created and host towers, and be able to change the settings for the towers you have created.
"""
        case .hostMode:
            return """
Host Mode is a special mode that can be enabled for towers in order to restrict who can direct the ringing at that tower. To enable Host Mode, you will need to go to the Tower Settings page on the ringingroom.com website and set the \"Permit Host Mode\" feature to \"Yes\".

A tower host is someone who has special privileges at a Ringing Room virtual tower. You can think of this as being like a tower captain or a ringing master: A host is someone who might take charge of a practice. A tower can have multiple hosts who can share responsibility for running practices. You can add hosts to towers that you have created by going to the My Towers page on the ringingroom.com website, finding the tower you want, clicking the Settings button, and entering the email address of the Ringing Room account you want to add as a host in the box at the bottom left. You can remove hosts from a tower by clicking the \"X\" icon in the list of tower hosts. The creator of a tower is always a host there.

If Host Mode is permitted at a tower, hosts have an extra switch in the tower controls, allowing them to enable or disable Host Mode. When a tower is in Host Mode, various restrictions are imposed:
    â¢ Only hosts may change the number of bells or switch between handbell and tower-bell mode.
    â¢ Non-hosts may only make calls when assigned to a bell.
    â¢ Non-hosts may only ring bells that they are assigned to.
    â¢ Only hosts may assign other ringers to bells.
    â¢ Non-hosts may assign themselves to open bells only â that is, they can \"catch hold\" of unused bells, but not displace other ringers.

Host mode can only be activated or deactivated by any hosts currently in the tower. If there are no hosts present in the tower, host mode will automatically be disabled so that ringing can proceed normally.
