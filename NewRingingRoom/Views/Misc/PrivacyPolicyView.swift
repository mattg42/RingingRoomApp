This app doesn’t collect any personal information, but it does collect crash reports and performance data if you have opted in on your device (you can find the setting by going to Settings > Privacy > Analytics and Improvements > Share With App Developers). However, it does use the Ringing Room API to function. Therefore Ringing Room is able to see all the requests made and use that information, such as your email address, as they see fit. By using this app, you are subject to Ringing Room’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at [ringingroom.com/privacy](https://ringingroom.com/privacy)")
